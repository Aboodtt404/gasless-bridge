### Issues Faced & Resolutions

**1. State Management Migration Challenges** ⚠️ **RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Compilation errors when migrating from simple storage to `ic-stable-structures`

- **Resolution**: Implemented proper `Storable` trait for all custom types using `serde_json` serialization

- **Impact**: Achieved professional, persistent state management following OISY patterns


**2. Type Conflicts in Price Feed System** ⚠️ **RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Duplicate `PriceData` type definitions causing compilation conflicts

- **Resolution**: Consolidated type definitions and used proper module imports

- **Impact**: Clean, maintainable codebase with proper type safety


**3. ICP Ledger Integration Complexity** ⚠️ **RESOLVED**

- **Issue**: Type annotation errors in inter-canister calls to ICP ledger

- **Resolution**: Added explicit type annotations for `call::call` operations

- **Impact**: Seamless integration with official ICP ledger for real token operations
